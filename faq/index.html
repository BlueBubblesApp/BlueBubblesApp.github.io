                    <p>Yes! You will need to set up a macOS VM (Virtual Machine) on either Windows or Linux. We have a handful of guides in
                        our <a href="https://docs.bluebubbles.app/server/advanced/running-a-macos-vm" style="color: #147efb; text-decoration: none;">documentation</a>,

                    <p>Q: Will I need port-forwarding for this to work?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>No, port-forwarding is not required. We offer built-in proxy services such as Ngrok or Cloudflare to allow the connection to your server.
                        However, those proxy services are hosted by third-parties. If you would like a completely self-hosted setup, we recommend port forwarding
                        with a dynamic DNS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some router manufacturers such as Asus sometimes include dynamic DNS plugins and/or Let's Encrypt certificate 
                        management to allow you to create a secure connection between a client and your server.
                    </p>
                    <p>Disclaimer: By using the third-party proxy services, you are accepting their respective licensing and usage agreements.</p>

                    <p>Q: Why do I need to sign up for Google's Firebase Service? </p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>
                        To minimize background battery usage, BlueBubbles does not maintain a direct socket connection between your phone and your server
                        when the app is not in focus. Google's Firebase Service is utilized to send notifications to your device when new messages arrive.
                        It is also used to allow you to perform a server reset when you cannot directly connect to your server.

                    <p>We aren't 100% sure why this issue happens, however, a simple reboot of the Mac usually fixes the issue. Also, signing up on ngrok's website may help the issue. Do the following:</p>
                    <p>Register for a free account at <a href="https://ngrok.com" style="color: #147efb; text-decoration: none;">ngrok</a>. After registering, you can find your account's Auth Token in their portal. Copy and paste that auth token into the token field within the BlueBubbles macOS Server settings. Copy and paste using CMD + V. Finally restart the server app and/or the Mac itself.</p>

                    <p>Q:  I'm only getting notifications sometimes, what's going on?</p>
                </div>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Often times, this is due to your phone manufacturer's OS-specific memory management strategies. You can view the full list of phone manufacturers and their respective "Don't Kill My App" Benchmarks, <a href="https://dontkillmyapp.com/" style="color: #147efb; text-decoration: none;">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>More specifically, the OS employs algorithms to detect which apps are using background memory, and killing them, or just preventing them from starting. As a result, the BlueBubble's background process has a chance of being killed, and you will not receive notifications. On most devices, the manufacturer will provide a way to disable battery optimization (memory management) on certain apps.</p>
                    <p>This is what you will need to do for BlueBubbles. Find the BlueBubble's App, then tap and hold on it to bring up the menu. Select the (i) Icon, which will take you to the App's Android Settings. Find the list item that pertains to Battery Optimization or Memory Management. You should see a few options to either disable or enable battery optimization. For best results, select the least restrictive setting. In most cases, this will be something like, Do not optimize.</p>                    
                    <p> You can find a more in-depth guide on the Don't Kill My App website, by selecting your phone manufacturer.</p>

                        <li><p>Verify you do not have a VPN, Proxy, or Custom DNS blocking Ngrok (this is common on school or work networks)</p></li>
                        <li><p>Try to connect to your server using the manual server URL/password entry</p></li>
                        <li><p>Please make sure your phone time is set automatically rather than manually. We've noticed this can cause connection issues sometimes.</p></li>

                        3. Locate and open "Messages" folder <br />
                        4. Delete every file that *ends with* .db in the name - if the has an additional extension, you should try this process first WITHOUT deleting those files.<br />
                        5. Restart your computer<br />
                        6. Open Messages and sign into iMessage again<br />
